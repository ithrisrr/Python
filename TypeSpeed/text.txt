45 years old and still breaking hearts eh
I am not in the danger skyler,I am the danger
I am Homelander,I can do whatever the f*ck I want
Who are you the proud lord said that I must bow so low
only a cat of a different coat thats all the truth I know
so he spoke that so he spoke the lord of castemere
and now the rain weep over his hall and not a soul to hear
